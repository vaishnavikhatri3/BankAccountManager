# BankAccountManager
Our C++ Banking Management System offers easy account handling, interest calculations, and secure transactions, empowering users to manage financesÂ efficiently.
Account Management: Users can create new accounts, view existing account details including balance, account type (savings or current), and account number.

Transaction Handling: The system enables users to deposit and withdraw money from their accounts. Upon each transaction, the balance is updated accordingly.

Savings Account Management: For savings accounts, the system calculates and applies interest based on predefined rates and time intervals. Users can visualize how their savings grow over time.

Current Account Handling: Current account users can monitor their transactions without interest calculations. The system ensures accurate record-keeping of all transactions for current accounts.

User Interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive, with clear navigation and informative displays. Users can easily access various features and obtain insights into their financial activities.

Security: Robust security measures are implemented to protect user data and transactions. This includes encryption techniques for sensitive information and authentication mechanisms for accessing accounts.

Reporting and Insights: Users can generate reports to track their financial activities, including transaction histories, interest earned (for savings accounts), and account summaries. These insights help users make informed decisions about their finances.
